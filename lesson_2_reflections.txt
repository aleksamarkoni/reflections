What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
   - directory .git is added to the directory that I am currently in.
   - it stores all the metadate for the git, so it could track files in
     my directory

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the
repository? What value do you think it offers?
   - Working directory is the directory in which you do all the work, and
   all the changes to the files are done in the working directory
   - Staging area, is a place where you put files when you are ready to do
   a commit. So you need to specify which files you want to add to commit
   with git add, and then that files are put in staging area. After that
   when you do commit files from the staging area are saved as a single
   commit in git repository.
